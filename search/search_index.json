They do not need to be imported ahead of time.</p> <ol> <li>Run specs (registered by decorator).    Run specs are registered at import time via <code>@helm.benchmark.run_spec.run_spec_function(...)</code> and are discoverable by name when you invoke <code>helm-run</code>.</li> </ol> <p>Key idea: the module containing the run spec function must be imported so registration code runs.

Single-file plugins (a standalone <code>.py</code>) are the simplest and most reliable.

One area that can benefit by improvements in artificial intelligence (AI) is healthcare. The note generation task from doctor-patient encounters, and its associated electronic medical record documentation, is one of the most arduous time-consuming tasks for physicians. It is also a natural prime potential beneficiary to advances in generative models. However with such advances, benchmarking is more critical than ever. Whether studying model weaknesses or developing new evaluation metrics, shared open datasets are an imperative part of understanding the current state-of-the-art.

In line with contributing towards this ever-growing field, we introduce AlGhafa, a new multiple-choice evaluation benchmark for Arabic LLMs. For showcasing purposes, we train a new suite of models, including a 14 billion parameter model, the largest monolingual Arabic decoder-only model to date.

Filing on behalf\n            of thirteen Black individuals and a class of similarly situated Black\n            apprenticeship test takers, the EEOC alleged that the individuals\u2019\n            employer, the Ford Motor Company, as well as their union, the United\n            Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural implement workers of America\n            (the \u201cUAW\u201d), and the Ford-UAW Joint Apprenticeship Committee, violated\n            Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, and Michigan state\n            anti-discrimination law.

It may sound difficult to believe it ,but the nerves which supply your forearms and hand, start at the level of spinal cord and on their way towards the forearm and hand regions which they supply, the course of these nerves pass through difference fascial and muscular planes that can make them susceptible to entrapment neuropathies. Its a group of conditions where a nerve gets compressed between a muscle and a bone, or between the fibers of a muscle that it pierces or passes through. Also, the compression can happen when the nerves are travelling around a blood vessel which can mechanically put pressure on them.

The risk of bias in the studies was generally high. We did not pool data from studies     because of significant differences in the interventions and outcomes evaluated. We found a lack of     standardisation and consistency in the outcomes measured and the endpoints at which they were evaluated.     We found no evidence that therapeutic exercises were better than TAU, or any other treatment, in improving the     safety and efficiency of oral swallowing (our primary outcome) or in improving any of the secondary outcomes.     Using the GRADE system, we classified the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome as very low, due to     the limited number of trials and their low quality. There were no adverse events reported that were directly     attributable to the intervention (swallowing exercises). We found no evidence that undertaking therapeutic     exercises before, during and/or immediately after HNC treatment leads to improvement in oral swallowing. This     absence of evidence may be due to the small participant numbers in trials, resulting in insufficient power to     detect any difference. Data from the identified trials could not be combined due to differences in the choice     of primary outcomes and in the measurement tools used to assess them, and the differing baseline and endpoints     across studies. Designing and implementing studies with stronger methodological rigour is essential. There needs     to be agreement about the key primary outcomes, the choice of validated assessment tools to measure them and the     time points at which those measurements are made.\",     \"pls\": \"We included six studies with 326 participants who undertook therapeutic exercises before, during and/or     after HNC treatment. We could not combine the results of the studies because of the variation in participants'     cancers, their treatments, the outcomes measured and the tools used to assess them, as well as the differing     time points for testing. Researchers have compared: (i) therapeutic exercises versus treatment as usual (TAU);     (ii) therapeutic exercises versus sham therapy; (iii) therapeutic exercises plus TAU versus TAU. The therapeutic     exercises varied in their design, timing and intensity. TAU involved managing patients' dysphagia when it     occurred, including inserting a tube for non-oral feeding. The evidence is up to date to 1 July 2016. We found     no evidence that therapeutic exercises were better than TAU, or any other treatment, in improving the safety and     efficiency of oral swallowing (our primary outcome) or in improving any of the secondary outcomes. However,     there is insufficient evidence to draw any clear conclusion about the effects of undertaking therapeutic     exercises before during and/or immediately after HNC treatment on preventing or reducing dysphagia. Studies had     small participant numbers, used complex interventions and varied in the choice of outcomes measured, making it     difficult to draw reliable conclusions. There were no reported adverse events directly attributable to the     intervention (swallowing exercises). The current quality of the evidence to support the use of therapeutic     exercises before, during and/or immediately after HNC treatment to prevent/reduce dysphagia is very low.

Moreover, the lack of reference explanations means we cannot easily evaluate the reasoning of model decisions, a crucial component of supporting doctors in making complex medical decisions. To address these challenges, we construct two new datasets: JAMA Clinical Challenge and Medbullets. JAMA Clinical Challenge consists of questions based on challenging clinical cases, while Medbullets comprises USMLE Step 2&amp;3 style clinical questions. Both datasets are structured as multiple-choice question-answering tasks, where each question is accompanied by an expert-written explanation.

Overview</p> <pre><code>MS MARCO (Microsoft MAchine Reading COmprehension) is a collection of\nlarge search datasets, collected using BING search questions, first\nreleased in (Bajaj et. al., 2016) and expanded ever since. The official\nMS MARCO website details all the available datasets and the proposed\ntasks: https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/.\n</code></pre> <p>II. Task</p> <pre><code>In this scenario, we are focusing on information retrieval tasks from\nthe MS MARCO benchmark. We frame the information retrieval task as a\nbinary classification problem, similar to\n(Nogueira and Jiang et. al., 2020). Specifically, given a context and a\nquestion, the model's job is to predict whether the context includes an\nanswer to the question by producing either a correct answer or a wrong\nanswer. The specific tokens used for the correct and wrong answers are\nspecified in the adapter specification. Shared below is an example of\nhow we would construct a prompt for a question, using 4 in-context\ntraining instances, where the correct and wrong output tokens are\nrespectively specified as `Yes` and `No` in the adapter specification.\nNote that the last instance in the example, which is the instance we\nare evaluating, doesn't have an answer - since we want our model to\nanswer the question.\n\n    Passage: Its 25 drops per ml, you guys are all wrong. If it is water, the standard was changed 15 - 20 years ago to make 20 drops = 1mL. The viscosity of most things is temperature dependent, so this would be at room temperature. Hope this helps.\n    Query: how many eye drops per ml\n    Does the passage answer the query?\n    Answer: Yes\n\n    Passage: RE: How many eyedrops are there in a 10 ml bottle of Cosopt? My Kaiser pharmacy insists that 2 bottles should last me 100 days but I run out way before that time when I am using 4 drops per day.In the past other pharmacies have given me 3 10-ml bottles for 100 days.E: How many eyedrops are there in a 10 ml bottle of Cosopt? My Kaiser pharmacy insists that 2 bottles should last me 100 days but I run out way before that time when I am using 4 drops per day.\n    Query: how many eye drops per ml\n    Does the passage answer the query?\n    Answer: No\n\n    Passage: : You can transfer money to your checking account from other Wells Fargo. accounts through Wells Fargo Mobile Banking with the mobile app, online, at any. Wells Fargo ATM, or at a Wells Fargo branch. 1 Money in \u2014 deposits.\n    Query: can you open a wells fargo account online\n    Does the passage answer the query?\n    Answer: No\n\n    Passage: You can open a Wells Fargo banking account from your home or even online. It is really easy to do, provided you have all of the appropriate documentation. Wells Fargo has so many bank account options that you will be sure to find one that works for you. They offer free checking accounts with free online banking.\n    Query: can you open a wells fargo account online\n    Does the passage answer the query?\n    Answer: Yes\n\n    Passage: SIZE: There are few measurements available for this bear. Adult spectacled bears can weigh between 140 and 385 pounds (63-173 kg). However, the body length of adults is about 150 to 180 centimeters (60 to 72 inches) and males may be 30 to 40 percent larger than females.\n    Query: how much does a spectacled bear weigh\n    Does the passage answer the query?\n    Answer:\n\nAs a result of each request, the model would produce a token or a set\nof tokens. To determine the ranking of a list of contexts for a\nquestion, we create a separate request for each context, where we pair\nthe question with the context and ask for model's answer.\n\nThen, in the corresponding metric for our scenario, the contexts are\nranked using the answer token and its log probability. Specifically, the\nordering looks like the list given below, from good contexts at the top\nto bad contexts at the bottom, where UNKNOWN_ANSWER would correspond\nto any token that is not one of correct or wrong answer tokens, using\ncase insensitive match excluding whitespace.\n\n    (1) CORRECT_ANSWER, highest log probability\n        ...\n        CORRECT_ANSWER, lowest log probability\n        ...\n        WRONG_ANSWER, lowest log probability\n        ...\n        WRONG_ANSWER, highest log probability\n        ...\n    (n) UNKNOWN_ANSWER(s)\n\nWe then use standard information retrieval metrics, such as RR and\nnDCG, to score the model using the rankings obtained using the strategy\ndescribed above.\n</code></pre> <p>III. Datasets</p> <pre><code>There are two ranking tasks in the MS MARCO benchmark: document ranking\nand passage ranking. Both of these tasks have several tracks, using\ndifferent subsets for the evaluation of the models. This scenario\ncurrently supports the passage ranking task tracks.\n\nAll the datasets used in this scenario are hosted and retrieved from one\nof the following repositories:\n\n    Official MS MARCO Website      | https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/\n    Benchmarking CodaLab Worksheet | https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0xf451c0dec2a6414aae0b68e8e325426c  # noqa\n    TREC Website                   | https://trec.nist.gov\n\nThis scenario makes use of 4 different types of files, explanation for\neach is given below, followed by a table listing the details for each\nof the datasets used.\n\n    document: The document files contain all the documents that could be\n        ranked for a question, each specified with an document ID\n        (docid). For example, for the passage track, the documents would\n        be passages.\n    query: The query files contain the questions for a given task,\n        each specified with a query ID (qid). Each task has a query file\n        including the training examples. The validation queries are\n        determined by the selected track of the task. Depending on the\n        task and split/track, the queries read from the queries file\n        are filtered to ensure they have corresponding qrels and top-k\n        information before instances for the query are created. Because\n        of this filtering, the number of queries in the query file\n        doesn't directly correspond the number of queries for which\n        instances can be created.\n    qrels: Each query file is accompanied by a qrels file, which\n        specifies the relationship between a query with ID qid and an\n        document with ID docid. The relevance values can have different\n        meanings depending on the split and the track. Note that not\n        all queries would have corresponding query relevances in the\n        accompanied file. Also note that multiple documents may have the\n        same relevance value with a qiven query.\n    topk: Each query file is accompanied by a top-k file, which lists\n        the IDs of the top k best documents for a query with their\n        accompanied rank. The top documents for each query were selected\n        using the BM25 algorithm. The notebook used to generate the\n        top-k files used in this scenario can be found at the\n        Benchmarking CodaLab Worksheet. Note that not all queries would\n        have a corresponding top-k documents in the accompanied file.\n\n    |      LOCAL FILE NAME        |  TRACK  |  TRACK  |              CONTENT              |        FORMAT         |              Host              | Notes |  # noqa\n    | passage_document.tsv        | passage |    -    | 8,841,823 passages                | &lt;docid&gt; &lt;text&gt;        | Benchmarking CodaLab Worksheet | (1)   |  # noqa\n    | passage_train_queries.tsv   | passage |    -    | 808,731   queries                 | &lt;qid&gt; &lt;text&gt;          | Official MS MARCO Website      |       |  # noqa\n    | passage_train_qrels.tsv     | passage |    -    | 532,761   query relations         | &lt;qid&gt; 0 &lt;docid&gt; &lt;rel&gt; | Official MS MARCO Website      | (2)   |  # noqa\n    | passage_train_topk.tsv      | passage |    -    | 20        top documents per query | &lt;qid&gt; &lt;docid&gt; &lt;rank&gt;  | Benchmarking CodaLab Worksheet | (3)   |  # noqa\n    | passage_regular_queries.tsv | passage | regular | 6980      queries                 | &lt;qid&gt; &lt;text&gt;          | Official MS MARCO Website      | (4)   |  # noqa\n    | passage_regular_qrels.tsv   | passage | regular | 7437      query relations         | &lt;qid&gt; 0 &lt;docid&gt; &lt;rel&gt; | Official MS MARCO Website      | (2)   |  # noqa\n    | passage_regular_topk.tsv    | passage | regular | 1000      top documents per query | &lt;qid&gt; &lt;docid&gt; &lt;rank&gt;  | Benchmarking CodaLab Worksheet |       |  # noqa\n    | passage_trec_queries.tsv    | passage | trec    | 200       queries                 | &lt;qid&gt; &lt;text&gt;          | Official MS MARCO Website      |       |  # noqa\n    | passage_trec_qrels.tsv      | passage | trec    | 502,982   query relations         | &lt;qid&gt; 0 &lt;docid&gt; &lt;rel&gt; | Official MS MARCO Website      | (5)   |  # noqa\n    | passage_trec_topk.tsv       | passage | trec    | 1000      top documents per query | &lt;qid&gt; &lt;docid&gt; &lt;rank&gt;  | Benchmarking CodaLab Worksheet |       |  # noqa\n\n        Notes:\n            (1) We use a pre-processed version of the passage\n                collection, introduced in (MacAvaney, et. al. 2021),\n                which greatly improves the quality of the passages. The\n                cleaned collection is hosted on the Benchmarking CodaLab\n                Worksheet as there is no other reliable publicly hosted\n                copy.\n            (2) The only relevance values is 1, which indicates that the\n                document with the ID the docid is the gold match for the\n                query with the ID qid.\n            (3) The number of top documents ranked was limited to 20 for\n                the training set as we only generate 2 instances per\n                training query, one corresponding to a gold matching\n                instance, and the other one corresponding to a probable\n                non-matching instance.\n            (4) The labels (qrels) of the official test queries are not\n                publicly released. Since we need to have access to the\n                qrels file to evaluate the models, we instead use the\n                development set (\"queries.dev.small.tsv\"), which can be\n                found at\n                https://msmarco.blob.core.windows.net/msmarcoranking/collectionandqueries.tar.gz\n            (5) The relevance values for the TREC task of the passage\n                track can be any of [0, 1, 2, 3]. We consider [0, 1] to\n                be wrong matches and [2, 3] to be gold matches.\n</code></pre> <p>IV.

SUMO further generates an extractive summary by presenting a diversified set of sentences from the documents that explain its decision on the correctness of the textual claim. Prior approaches to address the problem of fact checking and evidence extraction have relied on simple concatenation of claim and document word embeddings as an input to claim driven attention weight computation. This is done so as to extract salient words and sentences from the documents that help establish the correctness of the claim. However this design of claim-driven attention fails to capture the contextual information in documents properly. We improve on the prior art by using improved claim and title guided hierarchical attention to model effective contextual cues.

In addition, we standardize the standard inference parameters, methods of prompting, and evaluation metrics to enable fair comparisons across models.</p>"},{"location":"vhelm/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>Leaderboard</li> <li>Paper (TBD)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"vhelm/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>First, follow the installation instructions to install the base HELM Python page.</p> <p>To install the additional dependencies to run VHELM, run:</p> <pre><code>pip install \"crfm-helm[vlm]\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"vhelm/#quick-start","title":"Quick Start","text":"<p>The following is an example of evaluating <code>openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18</code> on 10 instance from the Accounting subset of MMMU.</p> <pre><code># Set OpenAI API key\nexport OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key\n\n# Download schema_vhelm.yaml\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stanford-crfm/helm/refs/heads/main/src/helm/benchmark/static/schema_vhelm.yaml\n\n# Run benchmark\nhelm-run --run-entries mmmu:subject=Accounting,question_type=multiple-choice,model=openai/gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 --suite my-vhelm-suite --max-eval-instances 10\n\n# Summarize benchmark results\nhelm-summarize --suite my-vhelm-suite --schema-path schema_vhelm.yaml\n\n# Start a web server to display benchmark results\nhelm-server --suite my-vhelm-suite\n</code></pre> <p>Then go to http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.</p>"},{"location":"vhelm/#reproducing-the-leaderboard","title":"Reproducing the Leaderboard","text":"<p>To reproduce the entire VHELM leaderboard, refer to the instructions for VHELM on the Reproducing Leaderboards documentation.</p>"}]}
